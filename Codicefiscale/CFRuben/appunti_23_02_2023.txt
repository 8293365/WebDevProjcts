in una pagina html all'inter
no di <script></script> devi usare 
solamente il linguaggio javascript, 
non dimenticarlo cretino, 

also "submit" 
direclty sends "forms"( checks whats included 
in form definition) directly to data handlers.

to redact: to block sensitive information from people 
"undeserving" of it

webster definition: edited especially in order to obscure 
or remove sensitive information

apparently the attribute (onclick="function()")
works only if the html element that possesses it has (type="button")
idk but it is like so in this iteration i'll just paste here the two parts

<script>
 function Poop(){
            return document.getElementById("FinalOutput").innerHTML= "12345";
        }
</script>


 <input type="button" Id="calculate" onclick="Poop()" value="Calculate" ></input>       <!--(value = "calculate") writes the text inside the button -->
        <input type="reset">Clear Page</input>
        <br>                    <!--(remember the submit is the type that delivers data to submit FORMS to data handlers)-> we don't do that here-->
        <br>
        <br>
        <p Id="FinalOutput"></p>
<!--this is the only combination that will leave the output on the paragraph the rest would just blink or not show up at all-->
also apparently the element name is irrelevant to the onclick call
